# Biography

Wagner Hugo Bonat is Researcher and Lecturer of the [Department of Statistics][1]
at Paraná Federal University([UFPR][2]), where he has been since 2010.
He is the Head of the Data Science and Big Data program ([DSBD][]) and 
a member of the Laboratory of Statistics and Geoinformation ([LEG][]).
He received a B.S. from Paraná Federal University in 2008, and an 
M.S. from the Paraná Federal University in 2010. He received his 
Ph.D. in Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of 
Southern Denmark in 2016.

His research lies on statistical modelling and estimating functions.
Much of his work has been on extending the generalized linear model
class to deal with multiple response variables. His main contribution
is a new class of multivariate models called Multivariate Covariance
Generalized Linear models (McGLMs) and the associated R package ([mcglm][])
